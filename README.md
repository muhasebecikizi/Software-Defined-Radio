Effects of AGC and Linear Block Coding Algorithms on PAM Radio with Noisy Channel
Software defined radio provides the transition from the hardware to the software implementation of the communication systems. Since, it is considered as milestone of the communication systems area. Applications becomes more flexible and cheaper within this change. Thus, the communication technologies also become easy to be improved. However, designing a reliable software defined communication system can be challenging. Especially the recovery of the transmitted message signal may be difficult without proper receiver design. Aim of this project designing a software defined radio that can smoothing away all of the corruptions during the transmission of a text massage. Normally, QAM and QPSK can provide improved	solutions for the noisy channel systems. However, to analyze the effects of the changed blocks properly, The most primitive system, the PAM system, was used. As it is known, the PAM system is the most vulnerable system when it comes to noise. Optimal actions need to be taken to properly transmit the signal. These operations were tried to be provided by making changes to the blocks. 
Enjoy!
